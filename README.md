========

A written-from-scratch, open-source, free-form, flexible, multi-purpose world creator for kids, developed by one-man team.

My first and only attempt to create a serious game with 3D/Gamestudio.
Source code can be compiled but must be [ heavily ] revised as it requires lots of fixed resources which I've made unavailable.

The lastest unstable, unusable alpha release is v0.21.
